My name is Sneha Ramasamy.Currently, I am in the third year of my graduation, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
In my family, we are a close-knit trio: my parents, who are proud owners of an Apparel Store, and myself, their only daughter. I find great interest in the realm of Computer Networks, a field that continually captivates my attention and drives my academic pursuits.
Beyond academics, I find solace and joy in the simplicity of gardening and the freedom of cycling. These hobbies offer me moments of tranquility amidst the rigors of student life.
My academic journey has been marked by notable achievements, including attaining the Silver Elite Batch in NPTEL examinations. Additionally, I've undertaken projects focused on leveraging IoT technology to aid offscum laborers, particularly in precarious situations such as within manholes.
I am passionate about honing my programming skills, often engaging with platforms like Skillrack to solve intricate problems and expand my knowledge base. My strengths lie in my diligence, organizational skills, and collaborative spirit, qualities that have enabled me to contribute effectively to workshops organized by the IETE organization at our college.
Furthermore, I've enriched my understanding of cybersecurity through participation in the "Introduction to Cybersecurity Internship" facilitated by CISCO. Additionally, I hold certifications in Google Cloud and have completed courses in Particle Dynamics and Image Processing on Coursera.
I actively seek opportunities to broaden my horizons through workshops on topics such as "Embedded Systems and IoT" and "AutoCAD 3D Modelling." Moreover, I've had the privilege of presenting on innovative projects like the Smart Dustbin using Arduino.
In the short term, my goal is to successfully complete my bachelor's degree without any academic setbacks. Looking ahead, my long-term aspiration is to contribute my skills and knowledge as a Network Engineer within your esteemed organization, envisioning myself in this role three years from now.
